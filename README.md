# NarrativeBridge: Enhancing Video Captioning with Causal-Temporal Narrative


Welcome to the official website for NarrativeBridge, a groundbreaking approach to video captioning that incorporates causal narrative and temporal dynamics. This project aims to enhance the understanding and generation of video captions by capturing the underlying cause-and-effect relationships and narrative flow within videos.

## ðŸŒ‰ Key Features

- **Causal-Temporal Narrative Captioning:** NarrativeBridge introduces a novel benchmark for video captioning called Causal-Temporal Narrative (CTN) captions, generated using a state-of-the-art language model.
- **Temporal Dynamics:** Our approach captures the temporal dynamics and causal relationships within videos, enabling more coherent and context-aware captions.
- **Multimodal Integration:** NarrativeBridge seamlessly integrates visual and textual information, leveraging the power of multimodal learning.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular video captioning datasets, outperforming existing approaches.


Let's explore the future of video captioning together! ðŸš€
